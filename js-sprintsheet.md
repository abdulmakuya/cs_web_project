Javascript Objects
IN JAVASCRIPT,OBJECTS ARE KING.IF YOU UNDERSTAND THEM - YOU UNDERSTAND JAVACRIPT

In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Dates are always objects
Maths are always objects
Regular expressions are always objects
Arrays are always objects
Functions are always objects
Objects are always objects

```javascript
//the following example creates a mm object with five properties
var mm = {
    	firstname:"Abdul",
      lastname:"Makuya",
      nickname:"Samid",
      adress:"Ukonga",
      profession: {
        one : "developer",
        two : "designer",
        three : "trainer"
      },
      getPassportDetails : function(){
        return "Person's detail is " + this.firstname +
               "lives at " + this.adress;
      }
    };
    console.log(mm.firstname);
    console.log(mm.profession);
    console.log(mm.getPassportDetails());
    console.log(mm.getPassportDetails);
